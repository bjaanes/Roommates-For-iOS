Roommates-iOS
=============

### Shared Housing - Made easy.


Roommates is an app to make living together easier. Shared housing can be a struggle, but we aim to solve these problems. By organizing messages to everyone and keeping track of tasks and expenses you can avoid a lot of conflicts with your roommates.

Keep your household organized and you and your roommates happy. 

### Release

~~Project is released and available on the App Store.~~

Project has been discontinued as a released product from my side of things. 
This is because Parse decided to shut down their services.
